This project is a Spring-based RESTful API for sorting data using algorithms like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort. The API accepts three parameters: the sorting algorithm, an array of integers, and the desired sort order (ascending/descending). It processes the data using the specified algorithm and returns the sorted array. Built with Spring Framework, the application uses dependency injection, autowiring, and beans for modularity. It is deployed on Apache Tomcat, ensuring robust HTTP request handling. Although HATEOAS was not implemented, the API demonstrates efficient algorithm integration and provides a foundation for future enhancements.
